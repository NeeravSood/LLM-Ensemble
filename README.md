# Ensemble of Language Models

This repository contains a Python application that demonstrates the use of an ensemble of large language models (LLMs) for varied response generation based on the context of the input. The application uses models from the Hugging Face Transformers library and is designed to dynamically select an appropriate model based on keywords detected in the user's input.

## What is an Ensemble?

An ensemble method in machine learning uses multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent learning algorithms alone. In the context of language models, an ensemble approach allows the application to leverage the strengths of various models, each trained on different datasets or optimized for different tasks, to handle a wider array of topics and queries more effectively.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Contains the main application logic for loading models, handling requests, and determining which model to use based on the input.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the necessary Python packages that need to be installed.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for setting up and running the application.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NeeravSood/LLM-Ensemble
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## How to Customize the Model Choices

To customize the ensemble with different or additional models, you need to:

1. **Add Model Identifiers**: Update the `model_keys` dictionary in `app.py` to include the identifiers of the new models you wish to incorporate. These identifiers should correspond to models available on the Hugging Face Model Hub.

2. **Modify Model Selection Logic**: Adjust the `chatbot_response` function to change how the model key is selected based on the input text. This might involve adding or modifying the keywords or phrases that trigger the selection of a specific model.

## Fine-Tuning the Ensemble

To make the ensemble more relevant to specific use cases, consider the following:

1. **Fine-Tuning Models**: If the existing pre-trained models do not sufficiently cover the nuances of your domain, you might consider fine-tuning them on a specialized dataset. This involves additional training steps that adjust the model weights to better reflect the vocabulary and style of your specific domain.

2. **Adjusting Response Handling**: Enhance how responses are generated and processed. This could involve setting different parameters for the generation process (like `max_length`, `temperature`, and `top_p`) based on the model or the type of query.

3. **Feedback Loop**: Implement a feedback mechanism to capture user feedback on responses, which can be used to further refine model selection and response generation strategies.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! Here are some of the ways you can contribute:

- **Improving Model Selection**: Proposals for more sophisticated model selection logic based on machine learning or rule-based methods.
- **Expanding Model Support**: Adding more models to the ensemble to cover additional languages or specialized domains.
- **Optimizing Performance**: Enhancements to the performance or scalability of the application.
